# The Agent Behind the Curtain: Building the Oz Cloud Agent Platform — Safia Abdalla, Warp Raw Transcript

[music]
>> Uh hi, welcome to this session. Uh it is
mysteriously titled The Agent Behind the
Curtain.
Um it's about how the team at Warp built
our cloud agent platform. Um
before I talk about the how though, I
want to talk about the why um and share
a little bit about my own background.
Um so, I've spent the past 8 years
building developer tooling.
Um I started off in open source in the
Python and data science space
um on the Jupiter Notebook core team. I
was a maintainer on the Interact
project. That work continued in my time
at Microsoft helping build APIs and SDKs
for web developers. Um and now I'm
working on bringing AI AI agents to the
cloud at Warp.
And one of the lessons that I've learned
in my time building developer tooling is
that really good dev tools meet devs
where they are and grow with them.
Um a tool that you're going to be using
every day should accommodate your
workflows, but also be really adaptable
as the like complexity and the nature of
the work changes.
And it's important for us to build
really great dev tools because dev tools
have a compounding effect on the world.
If you make a piece of software that
helps a developer or a builder do great
work, your ability to magnify how much
great software exists in the world
increases. So, I think it is super
important that these dev tools
accommodate people's workflows. And
people's workflows are important because
they love their preferences. You might
have a preference for a shell, a
language, a harness, a review process.
And something that adapts to your
workflows and preferences is going to be
more enjoyable to use and more enjoyable
to build software with. And it also
becomes like a part of how you think and
build. Um so, it's super important to be
attuned to that.
And this notion of tools meeting
developers where they are and growing
with them comes to light really clearly
in the progression of AI tooling in this
space.
So, this is the story for Warp
specifically, but it's also the story
for a lot of developer tools. Pre-AI
era, we had the Warp terminal, which
kind of met people in their command-line
workflows that they were used to.
And then this fantastic thing happened
where AI got introduced to developers,
and now you had a whole new set of tools
that was available to you locally on
your machine. And a lot of people
started to interact with agentic coding
patterns in their terminal, in their
IDE, in their editor.
And then eventually, we realized that we
had kind of reached the limits of what
we could do on our laptops, and we
wanted agents to do work that was more
long-running, that was adapted to
different constraints, and that work
needed to happen in the cloud.
Um and whenever you send anything to the
cloud, you adopt a lot of complexity um
because running things in the cloud
requires us to navigate a much messier
stack of infrastructure concerns. And
when I say we here, I mean the people
building developer tools cuz that is the
person that I am.
And it gets at one of the things that
are like a core principle in how we
think about unlocking capabilities here
and building good developer tools is
that platforms should take on complexity
before it reaches the user. A really
good experience should not expose
anything of if the leaky complexity that
it handles to you.
Um when we think about building our
cloud agent platform, we try and
structure it so that every primitive
models this philosophy of hiding
complexity from the user so they can
focus on the work that matters to them.
Um the first place that this shows up
when you're building a cloud agent
platform is where does the agent run if
it's not running on a developer's
machine?
Um, it needs a place to do its work like
any developer would and that place is
typically a sandbox. It's an isolated
environment in the cloud where agents do
this task.
When we started out building these out
for our cloud agent platform, our first
intuition was to provide self-hosted
sandboxes so that developers had a
really easy on-ramp for getting into our
cloud agent platform. You didn't have to
think about where your compute lived, it
was just there for you.
But the reality is that for teams doing
serious work, they're probably managing
their own infrastructure. They probably
have dev boxes that they need to
interact with and so something that is
hosted or managed is usually not
sufficient. You really need to be able
to run agent workloads on infrastructure
that people bring so it adapts to their
like security concerns, their deployment
practices,
their workflows and preferences on their
team.
And so we add support for not only
manage hosting but also self-hosting to
the platform and that is complexity that
you abstract away from the user and how
the behavior is modeled.
Um, the next kind of component is a
little bit more personal to people and
it's the harness that they want to use.
As we talked about earlier, people are
really passionate about the tools that
shape their workflows. Um, one of those
tools is the harness. Um, who here has a
preference for cloud code as a harness
locally?
Code X?
Something else entirely?
Right, so much diversity in the room and
we want to meet people where they work.
So you want to integrate multi-harness
support that not only accommodates
preferences but also gives people the
ability to do the use the right tool for
the job. And flexibility isn't something
that you just be like crammed into a
platform because the real risk you run
if you cram it in is that it becomes
fragmented. Your experience with working
with Claude is different from working
with Codex versus a custom harness that
you might have. And so, one of the key
properties is making sure that the
platform provides structure and
guardrails around the harness so that
the experience is consistent. Um for us,
this means that harnesses can interact
with all of the platform native
experiences. So, just being able to
store conversation state and rehydrate
it, being able to interact with the
artifacts and outputs that are produced
by agents, whether they're PRs, issues,
new files that are generated. All of
that should kind of be structured the
same way.
Okay, cool. So, we gave you a place for
your agent to run, and we gave you a
choice for what harness you use,
including Warp Zone harness and any
other harnesses that you want to bring.
Um
what if one agent isn't enough to do
work? That's the reality of most
software engineering.
I wish that I could just send off one
prompt and solve all of the problems
that exist in my software, but the
reality is that real engineering work
rarely fits inside one prompt. In a
typical workflow, you might need one
agent to go research a problem and plan
a solution. You might need another agent
to implement it, and you might need to
bring in a third to validate it. And you
might want each of these agents to use
different harnesses and different models
in order to have a real adversar-
adversarial and robust approach.
So, we have built-in support for that.
You can orchestrate agents across the
stack. Um
with a lot of agent-based experiences,
this orchestration happens via a prompt.
So, I say {slash} orchestrate, or I
queue the agent via prompting that I
want it to delegate work across multiple
sub agents for a task that I have here.
And this orchestrator agent will do all
of the messy complexity of interacting
with sub agents, mediating messages
between them, and tracking the work
that's happening for me behind the
scenes with a single prompt. We abstract
complexity away from the user by giving
them this experience.
This sort of like prompt-based model for
interacting with agents and subagents is
really powerful.
An even more interesting one is the
notion of interacting with agents and
subagents via the API.
So, everything in our surface area is
exposed via an API, and I can fire off a
request to say that I want to run a
subagent that is attached to a parent
agent um via configuration that I
provide. And this API is super magical
because
this is the key component of a platform.
Um it's exposing the primitives in a way
that users can build on top of.
Um the thing about great APIs and SDKs
is people can build on top of them,
which means that they're not restricted
to your UI or your opinion of how a
particular experience should look. This
is where like composability becomes
really powerful.
And so, we're trying to be intentional
about exposing an API for every key
component of the stack. So, this is APIs
for spinning up agents and subagents,
for managing the environments and
compute that these agents are running
in, for working with the artifacts that
they produce. All of that is exposed in
an API that you can build on top of.
Um
and this ability to build on top of
these primitives that are exposed via an
API becomes really useful because anyone
can build tools that overlap on top of
these agentic experiences.
>> [snorts]
>> Um
like interesting phenomena that's
happened for us internally is we have a
bunch of non-engineering teammates at
Warp who have been able to use our SDK
and API to build custom Slack bots to do
a bunch of things. Um so we have folks
in our developer relations team who have
actually built out tooling to help us
manage all of our social mentions. Um so
as tweets and Reddit posts and things
are coming in, we have agents that will
pick them up, do some sentiment analysis
on them, try and understand what the
user wants, and then propose a response
that um folks on our social media team
should use and um respond to the
original tweet or Reddit post or what
have you. And all of this is enabled by
our SDK. And you see like a plethora of
these types of experiences
um
internally at Warp. Um we have people
who have used them to help answer
queries about how our product is
working, do competitive research, all
sorts of interesting things.
Um and these primitives became a really
big deal for us specifically when we
decided to go open source.
Um as I mentioned earlier, Warp started
off as a terminal um but it grew into an
agentic development environment. And
about 3 months ago, we decided to go
open source.
Um this was like much anticipated,
long-awaited. It was a huge success for
us.
Um the number of like GitHub stars that
we had, I think catapulted from around
20,000 to over 60,000. We had thousands
of PRs. I'll talk a little bit more
about how we've been managing that. And
hundreds of contributors who had been
long-time users of the platform and were
finally getting a chance to build on top
of it.
And when we went open source, we wanted
to be really thoughtful about how we
could use agents to help us manage the
repository.
We didn't want this to be the kind of
thing where agents are just writing code
and firing off PRs. We want them them to
participate kind of meaningfully in the
structure that we use to triage issues
that came into the repo, provide context
around them, do implementation, do
reviews,
but still have the space for humans to
participate in this loop.
And we did that. So, if you go to the
Warp open-source repo right now, you'll
notice that if you file a new issue with
a bug report or a feature request, an
agent will kick in and start to triage
the issue automatically. It'll do
research across the code base and
context in the repo to understand what
you're trying to propose. It might ask
you questions if it feels like your
original query was a little abstract to
get more information, and it will kind
of do the work that's historically been
very hard for open source, which is
somebody has a problem or a bug that
they want fixed. They don't give you
enough details, and it's hard to get to
the clarity that you need to get to to
like drive the work forward. So, we can
use agents to help us meaningfully in
that way. They can also help draft
initial specifications and work for
tasks, do implementation, and provide a
review gate. So, all PRs that get
contributed to Warp go through an
agent-managed review process. And it
goes through multiple iterations, and we
don't actually ping any of the human
reviewers on our team until an agent has
approved our PRs, um which helps manage
the workload a lot for the team. So, all
of those thousands of PRs, the things
that humans actually have to manage are
only the high-signal, high-quality ones.
And one of the key principles is that we
improve the agent as um we get more PRs
in the repo and we see more examples of
code. One of the things that we believe
is that self-improvement loops are a
really important way for you to enhance
the overall SDLC life cycle that you're
seeing.
So, we did this.
And we had a lightbulb moment cuz it
unlocked something huge. We had this
like structured process that could
accommodate a big influx of issues and
PRs on the repo. Um
and the agents were there to support
anyone in bringing their idea or their
bug request bug feature request or bug
report to us or to work and then getting
it through to the actual product.
That key insight of agents providing
like structure and context was a really
big thing for us cuz it meant that it
could anyone could kind of participate
in translating their intent into
implementation.
And often times the people who have
really interesting intents and goals are
the ones who are using software in
interesting ways. And it's not always
the person that's building it. It's the
person who's kind of got domain
knowledge in the space. And work we're
lucky because we're developers building
a developer tool and that's a really
unique niche to fill in. But most
software is developers building tools
for non-developers
or people in situations where they don't
have domain expertise.
If we provide these structures and
guardrails though, people who are
non-developers can
have the necessary tools to like ship
serious software because the
infrastructure to support them exists.
Oh, this is where like things get buzzy.
You might have heard this term of the
software factory. People talk about it a
lot as far as like automating how
software gets built, providing these
systems for doing work,
all of these fun things.
I kind of want to push back on this term
a little bit. I kind of actually hate it
cuz I don't think it gets the point
across and it feels a little
Where's the people in this?
So I want to tell a story
before I share what I think is actually
the better word. So this is a mug that I
have. I bought this mug about two
summers ago from a farmer's market.
And I stopped by this booth at the
farmer's market and you could just tell
the person who had crafted this the
potter was just someone who's like
really passionate about their work and
what they do. And so, he was telling me
about all of these interesting details
in the mug, the specific like curve of
the handle, and the way he had
structured it to accommodate different
people's hands. He had this like
specific dimple at the top of the handle
where you could rest your thumb cuz he
felt like that was like a key ergonomic
detail of this mug. He had this glazing
at the top, so if like your cup
overflowed, it wouldn't dribble down the
sides, the glazing would kind of catch
it. So, he just spent so much time
thinking about the details of the mug
and crafting it.
And then I was kind of talking to him
about his workshop, like how many
potters do you have? How many of these
mugs are you making? Yada yada.
And he got more even more animated and
he started talking about his workshop
setup and how he had set up different
stations for different components of the
mug. He had talked about how he had a
specific process for sourcing clay and
preparing ahead of time. He talked about
how he actually incorporated
verification for different components of
the mug. If the dimple wasn't the right
size, what would you do? What part of
the process would you restart?
All of this thought that he had put not
into the mug itself, but how the
workshop existed to support the creation
of the mug, and how he was able to scale
this to dozens of apprentices in his
shop and like hundreds of mugs
handcrafted per day, which is pretty
impressive.
And this got me thinking, I love what he
did with his workshop. Um he had this
really great idea and he developed a
serious and repeatable system that
allowed anyone to take the idea of a
perfect mug and turn it into the like
actual existence of a perfect mug.
You know,
some people might think like workshops
are this quaint thing where it's like a
workspace for a single individual, but I
think the story really shows that
they're actually heavy-duty systems for
doing work and that they're malleable
and that they react to signals in how
people are interacting with the thing
they're building in the space they're
building it.
Um and it also underscores the like
really close interaction loop that
humans have with the spaces they work in
and the outputs that are produced. And
I'm synthesizing all of these ideas and
I think this is what really we're
driving at when we talk about building
software factories.
We want to give more builders and the
definition of who a builder is is
expanding to non-developers
serious systems for turning their ideas
into code. Um and we as individuals
who've been building dev tooling or have
been in software engineering for a long
time have an understanding of what that
serious system looks like and what kind
of support it needs to give into
individuals.
Um we break this down into the same
techniques that my potter friend had and
the same methodologies that I talked
about earlier about exposing primitives.
Um we expose things like the ability for
these agents to implement automations
that react to events in the real world
the same way that a human in a workspace
might need need to react to a real event
of you know a kiln um being astray or a
handle being broken.
We need to make these systems
observable. My potter friend talked
about how he actually watched the way
people worked in his space and refined
the process over time. That doesn't come
for free. Your system has to actually be
something that you can inspect and look
into.
And it has to improve over time. The
workspace is not the static component
that doesn't change ever. It needs to
react to what's going on and modify
itself to amend to like the goals of the
people that are working in it and the
product that it's producing.
And it needs to be cost-effective. Uh
you want to reduce the number of broken
mugs that come out the other end. You
want to reduce the amount of buggy
software that comes out of the other end
of your of your factory. Um and you want
to do this without compromising on cost
without spending too many tokens.
All of these principles work to achieve
a shared goal and that shared goal is
building systems that remove toil and
drudgery from our software process so
that more people have the ability to
build. We've seen the way like toil and
drudgery have manifested. It could be
all of the difficulty you might have
reproducing a bug, the challenges of
monitoring a production system. Those
are things that are really hard to do.
And we can finally start to think about
the structure of how we do them and
building systems that allow us to do
them repeatedly and transferably to
people who are in non-technical roles.
If these ideas excite you about how we
can build these robust and reliable
systems for anyone to ship software,
you could stop by the Warp booth to come
talk to me and the crew. We're at UG 20.
You can also mention me on Twitter. I'm
Captain Sophia on all social media,
GitHub, Twitter, all of that fun stuff.
Or just drop me an email. You can find
my email on my personal site.
Thanks for coming to this presentation.
I hope you learned something interesting
about some of the engineering
philosophies that are driving the next
set of work we do as far as agents,
developers, and AI.
